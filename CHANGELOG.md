## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Remove 159 lines of dead code: unused interfaces, functions, config constants, legacy no-op timer, and stale barrel re-exports

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Fix race condition in StateStore where dirty flag was overwritten after async write, silently discarding mutations
- Fix PlanOrchestrator session leak by adding session.stop() in finally blocks and centralizing cleanup
- Fix symlink path traversal in file-content and file-raw endpoints by adding realpathSync validation
- Fix PTY exit handler to clean up sessionListenerRefs, transcriptWatchers, runSummaryTrackers, and terminal batching state
- Fix sendInput() fire-and-forget by propagating runPrompt errors to task queue via taskError event
- Fix Ralph Loop tick() race condition by running checkTimeouts/assignTasks sequentially with per-iteration error handling
- Fix shell injection in hook scripts by piping HOOK_DATA via printf to curl stdin instead of inline embedding
- Narrow tail-file allowlist to remove ~/.cache and ~/.local/share paths that exposed credentials
- Fix stored XSS in quick-start dropdown by escaping case names with escapeHtml()

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix 3 minor memory leaks: clear respawn timers in stop(), clean up persistDebounceTimers on session cleanup, reset \_parentNameCache on SSE reconnect
