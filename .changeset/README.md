# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find
the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## What is a changeset?

A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds three bits of information:

- What packages need to be released
- What semver bump type each package should receive (major / minor / patch)
- A summary of the changes

## How do I create a changeset?

Run `npx changeset` or create a `.md` file in this directory with the following format:

```markdown
---
"codeman": patch
---

Description of changes
```

The frontmatter specifies which package(s) to bump and the bump type. The body is the changelog entry.
